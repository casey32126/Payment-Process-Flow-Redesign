**# Payment Process Flow Redesign**
**### Project Overview**

**Title**: Redesigning the Payment Process Flow for Enhanced UX & Conversions
**Objective**: To improve the user journey from selecting a skip to final payment, optimizing for clarity, usability, and business value.

**####Key Problems Identified**
**1. Step Indicator**
-Step numbers were unclear or missing
-Current and completed steps shared the same styling, causing confusion
**2. Skip Cards Page**
-Oversized cards with excessive white space
-Repeated or irrelevant elements like duplicate Skip 4s
-Image dominance reduced emphasis on actionable info
-Poor contrast and no information hierarchy
**3. Overall Page Clarity**
-Price displayed without VAT context
-VAT included in total but not communicated to user
-Users had to guess pricing breakdown


**####Step Indicator - Before & After**
**#####Problems:**
-No clear visual progress
-No distinction between current and completed steps
**#####Solutions:**
-Added numbered steps
-Introduced check mark icons for completed steps
-Applied distinct styles: upcoming (neutral), current (highlighted), completed (checked)
**##### Impact:**
-Users can now confidently track where they are and how many steps remain — increasing trust and reducing drop-offs.

-Offer visual reassurance (steps, pricing, warnings)
-Respect time by eliminating distractions

**##### Business Impact**
**Expected Benefits:**
-Higher conversion rate due to simplified skip selection
-Fewer support tickets about pricing and step confusion
-Improved user retention during checkout

#### Conclusion
-This redesign focused on solving actual pain points through clarity, transparency, and user-focused structure. With the modernized UI/UX, we expect measurable improvements in user behavior and overall satisfaction.
