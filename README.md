# **Payment Process Flow Redesign**<br>
### **Project Overview**<br>

**Title**: Redesigning the Payment Process Flow for Enhanced UX & Conversions<br>
**Objective**: To improve the user journey from selecting a skip to final payment, optimizing for clarity, usability, and business value.<br>

#### **Key Problems Identified**<br>
**1. Step Indicator**<br>
- Step numbers were unclear or missing<br>
- Current and completed steps shared the same styling, causing confusion<br>
**2. Skip Cards Page**<br>
- Oversized cards with excessive white space<br>
- Repeated or irrelevant elements like duplicate Skip 4s<br>
- Image dominance reduced emphasis on actionable info<br>
- Poor contrast and no information hierarchy<br>
**3. Overall Page Clarity**<br>
- Price displayed without VAT context<br>
- VAT included in total but not communicated to user<br>
- Users had to guess pricing breakdown<br>


#### **Step Indicator - Before & After**<br>
##### **Problems:**<br>
- No clear visual progress<br>
- No distinction between current and completed steps<br>
##### **Solutions:**<br>
- Added numbered steps<br>
- Introduced check mark icons for completed steps<br>
- Applied distinct styles: upcoming (neutral), current (highlighted), completed (checked)<br>
##### **Impact:**<br>
- Users can now confidently track where they are and how many steps remain — increasing trust and reducing drop-offs.<br>

#### **Pricing Transparency** <br>
##### **Problems:** <br>
- 20% VAT was silently added <br>

- Users couldn’t understand why price increased <br>
##### **Solutions:**<br>
- Added textual notice about VAT being included <br>
- Displayed both before-VAT and after-VAT prices clearly <br>
##### **Impact:**<br>
- Improved trust in pricing <br>
- Reduced confusion and support queries <br>

#### **UX Strategy & Design Principles**
##### **Design Best Practices Applied:**
- Clarity over cleverness (simple progress tracker) <br>

- Minimalistic card structure <br>
- State-based interaction cues (hover, selected, inactive) <br>
##### **User Experience Goals:**
- Guide the user, don't overwhelm <br>
- Offer visual reassurance (steps, pricing, warnings) <br>
- Respect time by eliminating distractions <br>

##### **Business Impact** <br>
**Expected Benefits:** <br>
- Higher conversion rate due to simplified skip selection <br>
- Fewer support tickets about pricing and step confusion <br>
- Improved user retention during checkout <br>

#### Conclusion <br>
- This redesign focused on solving actual pain points through clarity, transparency, and user-focused structure. With the modernized UI/UX, we expect measurable improvements in user behavior and overall satisfaction.
